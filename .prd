## REMAINING WORK

### Phase 2: OpenCode Integration (BLOCKED - No Persistent Storage)
**Investigation:** OpenCode does NOT store persistent conversation history.
- ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json contains only MCP server config
- No sessions-index.json or history.jsonl found in OpenCode directories
- Recommendation: Document as limitation, defer until OpenCode SDK provides conversation API

### Phase 3: Sync & Consistency (BLOCKED - Depends on Phase 2)
- [ ] File watchers for history changes
- [ ] Auto-import new conversations from CLI
- [ ] Keep GUI database in sync with filesystem
- [ ] Handle conflicts
- [ ] Implement read-only mode for imported conversations

### Issue #1: Conversation Selection Timeout (DEFERRED)
- Root cause identified: fetchMessages() API performance issue
- Location: /static/app.js line 762
- Deferred: Requires backend API optimization
- Status: Can test once backend is responsive
