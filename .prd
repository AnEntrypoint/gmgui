## PHASE 6: ERROR HANDLING AND CONSOLE CHECK (SEQUENTIAL)
Status: PENDING
Dependencies: PHASE 4, PHASE 5
Blocks: PHASE 7
- Open DevTools (F12 equivalent) in browser:execute
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Check for network errors
- Check for console warnings
- Check for failed resource loads
- Verify zero blocking errors
- Take screenshot of console

## PHASE 7: CONCURRENT EXECUTION TEST (SEQUENTIAL)
Status: PENDING
Dependencies: PHASE 6
Blocks: PHASE 8
- Start first execution: claude /tmp/test-repos/lodash
- Task: "List the main utility functions in lodash"
- Wait for execution to show events flowing (30-50% progress)
- While first execution running, start second execution: claude /tmp/test-repos/chalk
- Task: "Analyze the chalk library color utilities"
- Monitor both streams concurrently:
  * Verify outputs don't mix together
  * Verify each has separate status display
  * Verify each has separate progress bar
  * Verify each has separate event counter
  * Verify both continue streaming independently
  * Verify both complete successfully
- Take screenshots showing both running simultaneously

## PHASE 8: DARK MODE TEST (SEQUENTIAL)
Status: PENDING
Dependencies: PHASE 2, PHASE 7
Blocks: PHASE 9
- Click theme toggle button (found in PHASE 2)
- Verify dark mode activates
- Check that:
  * Background changes to dark color
  * Text color changes to light color
  * All text remains readable
  * RippleUI dark theme applies to all components
  * Buttons update colors
  * Progress bars render in dark theme
- Take screenshot of dark mode interface
- Toggle back to light mode
- Verify light mode restores correctly
- Take screenshot of light mode

## PHASE 9: FINAL VALIDATION AND DOCUMENTATION (SEQUENTIAL)
Status: PENDING
Dependencies: PHASE 8
- Collect all screenshots from PHASE 2-8
- Create summary document at /home/user/agentgui/TEST_RESULTS.md:
  * Test 1: Server startup - PASS/FAIL
  * Test 2: UI rendering - PASS/FAIL with component list
  * Test 3: Repository clones - PASS/FAIL with paths

  * Test 5: File operations - PASS/FAIL with file path
  * Test 6: Console errors - PASS/FAIL with error count
  * Test 7: Concurrent execution - PASS/FAIL with evidence
  * Test 8: Dark mode - PASS/FAIL
- Document findings:
  * All functionality working: YES/NO
  * Zero blocking errors: YES/NO
  * Beautiful UI rendering: YES/NO
  * Concurrent execution works: YES/NO
  * Real Claude Code execution verified: YES/NO
  * All output captured and displayed: YES/NO

✓ Actual browser window with real HTTP requests
✓ Real Claude Code CLI execution in /tmp/test-repos
✓ Real streaming JSON output
✓ Real database persistence
✓ Real WebSocket events
✓ User witnesses working system with own eyes
✓ All failures fixed immediately and re-tested
