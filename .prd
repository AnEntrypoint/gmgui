### Phase 8-10 Status (TODO)
✗ lib/model-downloader.js NOT imported in server.js
✗ server.js ensureModelsDownloaded() uses old webtalk/ipfs-downloader (lines 66-125)
✗ Real IPFS CIDs not obtained (Pinata script not executed)
✗ database.js still has placeholder CIDs

## DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS

### Wave 1 (COMPLETE - all items removed from work breakdown)

### Wave 2 (COMPLETE)
✓ Pinata API keys: BLOCKED - not available, user needs to sign up at https://www.pinata.cloud/
✓ Integration strategy designed - 150-200 line implementation, backward compatible, per-file iteration

### Wave 3-4 (COMPLETE)
✓ Integration already implemented in server.js (lines 67-157)
✓ Refactored model-downloader.js from 289→191 lines (created download-metrics.js, file-verification.js)
✓ All files now < 200 lines (CHARTER 5 compliant)
✓ Imports verified working, no functionality changes
✓ Item 6 BLOCKED on Pinata API keys (will skip for now)

### Wave 5 (Depends on Wave 4, final verification)
10. Test fallback chain with fresh cache (delete ~/.gmgui/models, verify IPFS layer 1)
    - Blocked by: Wave 4 items 8, 9
    - Blocks: Nothing (end-to-end test)

11. Test fallback to HuggingFace (simulate IPFS failure)
    - Blocked by: Wave 4 items 8, 9
    - Blocks: Nothing (end-to-end test)

12. Verify metrics collection after real downloads
    - Blocked by: Wave 4 items 8, 9
    - Blocks: Nothing (validation)

## UNKNOWNS TO RESOLVE

### Code Implementation Unknowns (Wave 1 RESOLVED)
✓ downloadWithFallback IPFS gateway list: YES - cycles all 4 gateways (Cloudflare, dweb.link, Pinata, ipfs.io) × 2 retries = 8 attempts
✓ downloadWithFallback error handling: YES - properly catches and continues on gateway failure
✓ downloadWithFallback progress reporting: YES - onProgress receives correct status for each layer
✓ Manifest integration: YES - downloadWithFallback correctly validates against manifest SHA-256
✓ File path construction: Direct iteration over manifest.files object, each key is relative path

### Integration Unknowns (Waves 2-4 RESOLVED)
✓ Current ensureModelsDownloaded flow: webtalk is npm package with ensureModels, checkTTSModelExists, checkWhisperModelExists
✓ Backward compatibility: full replacement possible, webtalk no longer called (still imported for downloadWithProgress elsewhere)
✓ Progress broadcasting: transformation implemented (layer→source, status→downloading, progress percentage calculated)
✓ Error handling: throws error with message, caught in try/catch, broadcast error event with modelDownloadState.error
✓ Concurrent download handling: modelDownloadState.downloading flag prevents concurrent downloads (lines 67-72 wait loop)

### Environment Unknowns
- Pinata API keys: are they available? (blocks real IPFS publishing)
- IPFS gateway reachability: can we access Cloudflare/dweb.link/Pinata from this environment?
- Network constraints: timeouts sufficient for 280MB + 198MB downloads?

### Database Unknowns
- CID format: are placeholder CIDs correct format (bafybei...)?
- Gateway URL: should database store per-gateway URLs or single gateway?
- Download tracking: is recordDownloadStart properly integrated?

## EDGE CASES & CORNER CASES

### Network Scenarios
- All IPFS gateways unreachable → fallback to HuggingFace
- HuggingFace rate limiting → retry logic sufficient?
- Partial download (connection drop mid-file) → temp file cleanup?
- Network switching during download → resume or restart?
- Firewall blocking IPFS ports → fallback working?

### File System Scenarios
- Disk full during download → cleanup and error reporting?
- Permission denied on ~/.gmgui/models → fallback directory?
- Corrupted manifest file → regenerate or error?
- Partial manifest (missing sha256 for some files) → skip validation?
- Concurrent writes to same file → locking mechanism?

### Cache Scenarios
- Cache hit but file corrupted → detect and re-download
- Cache hit but wrong version → version check mechanism?
- Stale cache (90+ days old) → serve stale or force refresh?
- Manifest mismatch with actual files → which is source of truth?

### IPFS Publishing Scenarios
- Pinata upload timeout (slow upload) → retry with backoff?
- Pinata quota exceeded → alternative publishing method?
- CID changes on re-publish → database migration path?
- Partial upload (some files missing) → validation before CID storage?

### Integration Scenarios
- Old webtalk code still called by other modules → identify dependencies
- Config object mismatch between old/new systems → adapter needed?
- Progress event format incompatibility → transform events?
- Multiple conversations triggering download simultaneously → download once, notify all?

### Metrics Scenarios
- Metrics file corrupted → reset or recover?
- Metrics file too large (>1GB) → rotation working?
- Concurrent metric writes → locking or append-only safe?
- Metric timestamp drift → clock synchronization issue?

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (GATE CONDITIONS)

### Implementation Completeness
- downloadWithFallback cycles through all 3 IPFS gateways before HuggingFace fallback
- SHA-256 verification occurs for every downloaded file against manifest
- Size validation (minBytes) occurs before SHA-256 check
- Progress events emitted for each layer attempt
- Metrics recorded for cache hit, each gateway attempt, HuggingFace attempt, all failures
- Temp files (.tmp) cleaned up on failure
- Backup files (.bak) created on corrupted cache detection

### Integration Correctness
- model-downloader.js imported in server.js
- ensureModelsDownloaded calls downloadWithFallback for each file in manifest
- Progress broadcasting compatible with existing WebSocket protocol
- Error messages surfaced to UI via existing error broadcast mechanism
- Concurrent download requests handled (single download, multiple waiters)
- No regression in existing model download behavior

### Database Accuracy
- Real IPFS CIDs stored in database.js (not placeholders)
- getIpfsCidByModel returns correct CID for whisper-base and tts-models
- Download records created in ipfs_downloads table
- Last accessed timestamp updated on CID retrieval

### End-to-End Verification
- Fresh install (empty ~/.gmgui/models) downloads all models successfully
- IPFS layer succeeds (witnessed download from Cloudflare/dweb.link/Pinata gateway)
- HuggingFace fallback works (simulate IPFS failure, verify HF download)
- Cache layer works (second download instant, metrics show cache hit)
- Corrupted cache detected and re-downloaded
- Metrics populated with real download data
- All 4 metrics endpoints return valid data

### Performance & Reliability
- 280MB whisper-base downloads in <5 minutes on 10Mbps connection
- 198MB tts-models downloads in <4 minutes on 10Mbps connection
- Gateway failover occurs within 30 seconds of timeout
- No memory leaks during large file downloads
- Progress updates at least every 5 seconds during active download

### Code Quality
- No duplicate code between old webtalk and new model-downloader
- All functions under 200 lines
- No hardcoded values (gateways, timeouts, paths configurable)
- Error messages descriptive (include layer, gateway, error type)
- No console.log for normal operations (use debug hooks or proper logging)

## REMAINING WORK BREAKDOWN

### Waves 2-4 (COMPLETE)
✓ Code Exploration: webtalk is npm package (external), no local files
✓ Integration Design: manifest iteration, progress transformation, concurrent handling (existing flag)
✓ Implementation: Import added, ensureModelsDownloaded rewritten with downloadWithFallback
✓ Testing: Cache hits (13/13 files, 4ms), missing file re-download (59KB verified), metrics recorded

### IPFS Publishing (BLOCKED - No API Keys Available)
✓ 17. Checked PINATA_API_KEY: NOT SET
✓ 18. Checked PINATA_SECRET_KEY: NOT SET
✓ 19. Blocking status documented below
✗ 20. Cannot obtain real CIDs (BLOCKED on keys)
✗ 21. Cannot update database.js (BLOCKED on keys)

**BLOCKING STATUS**: Pinata API keys not available in environment.
**USER ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Sign up at https://www.pinata.cloud/
2. Get API key and secret
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export PINATA_API_KEY=your_jwt_token
   export PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret
   ```
4. Run: `node scripts/publish-models-to-ipfs.js`
5. Update database.js lines 389-390 with real CIDs from output

### Verification (VERIFY state - COMPLETE)
✓ 22. All 13 model files exist with correct sizes (whisper: 7, tts: 6)
✓ 23. Server integration verified (ensureModelsDownloaded uses downloadWithFallback)
~ 24. IPFS layer attempted but failed with HTTP 404 (expected - placeholder CIDs)
✓ 25. Metrics API endpoints functional (1 entry in .metrics.json)
✓ 26. SHA-256 verification PASSED for all 13 files
✓ 27. Cache hit mechanism implemented (size check before download)
~ 28. HuggingFace fallback exists but not tested (would require deleting cache)
~ 29. Metrics collection working (1 IPFS error recorded)

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR USER

1. Pinata API keys: Are PINATA_API_KEY and PINATA_SECRET_KEY available? (blocks real IPFS publishing)
2. Gateway preference: Should IPFS be preferred over HuggingFace, or configurable?
3. Old webtalk code: Can we fully replace webtalk/ipfs-downloader, or keep as fallback?
4. Metrics retention: Is 24-hour metrics retention sufficient, or longer?
5. Error handling: Should download failure block server startup, or degrade gracefully?

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION

- Code exploration: 30 minutes (7 files to read and trace)
- Integration design: 45 minutes (map files, design flows)
- Implementation: 60 minutes (rewrite ensureModelsDownloaded, test)
- IPFS publishing: 15 minutes (if keys available) or 0 minutes (if blocked)
