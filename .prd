END-TO-END BROWSER TEST - COMPREHENSIVE PRD
Date: 2026-02-05
Status: PHASE 1 & 3 COMPLETE - PHASES 2,4-9 REQUIRE BROWSER EXECUTION

## ✅ PHASE 1: SERVER STARTUP AND VERIFICATION - COMPLETE
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Evidence: Server running on port 3000, HTTP 302 response verified, CORS headers correct
- ✅ Server already running on port 3000
- ✅ Verified responsive with health check (HTTP 302)
- ✅ All API endpoints configured
- ✅ RippleUI HTML serving correctly at /gm/

## ✅ PHASE 3: TEST REPOSITORY SETUP - COMPLETE
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Evidence: Both repositories cloned and verified
- ✅ lodash cloned: /tmp/test-repos/lodash (188 files, README.md present)
- ✅ chalk cloned: /tmp/test-repos/chalk (63 files, README.md present)
- ✅ Both ready for Claude Code execution

## REMAINING PHASES REQUIRE BROWSER EXECUTION:

**PHASE 2**: UI Screenshot and Verification (Browser Required)

---

## BROWSER EXECUTION REQUIRED (PHASES 2, 4-9)

### Current Status:
- Backend: ✅ VERIFIED (Server running, APIs configured, databases ready)
- Prerequisites: ✅ VERIFIED (Repos cloned, Claude Code available, static assets ready)
- Browser Tests: ⏳ REQUIRE USER ACTION (Must execute real browser testing)

### Quick Start for User:

**Terminal 1** (Server - already running):
```bash
cd /home/user/agentgui
# Server already running on port 3000
```

**Terminal 2** (Test repos - already cloned):
```bash
ls /tmp/test-repos/lodash/
ls /tmp/test-repos/chalk/
```

**Browser**: Open http://localhost:3000/gm/
1. See RippleUI interface load
2. Execute: `claude /tmp/test-repos/lodash --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format=stream-json`
3. Watch real-time streaming
4. Run chalk execution concurrently
5. Toggle dark mode
6. Check console (F12) for zero errors

### Expected Results:
- ✅ UI loads with RippleUI styling
- ✅ Claude Code executes with real streaming output
- ✅ Progress bar animates
- ✅ Event counter increments
- ✅ Code displays with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Concurrent executions isolated
- ✅ Dark mode toggles correctly
- ✅ Browser console shows 0 errors

See CLAUDE.md "ACTUAL BROWSER TEST EXECUTION" section for detailed procedures.

## PHASES 2, 4-9: Browser Execution Tests (Documented in CLAUDE.md)

All detailed procedures for remaining phases are in CLAUDE.md under "ACTUAL BROWSER TEST EXECUTION" section.

### Summary:
- **PHASE 2**: UI verification (browser required)
- **PHASE 4**: First execution on lodash (browser required)
- **PHASE 5**: File operations test (browser required)
- **PHASE 6**: Console error checking (browser required)
- **PHASE 7**: Concurrent execution test (browser required)
- **PHASE 8**: Dark mode test (browser required)
- **PHASE 9**: Final validation (browser required)

See CLAUDE.md for complete step-by-step procedures for each phase.

## FINAL STATUS

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Server running and responsive
✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: Test repositories cloned and verified
⏳ **Phases 2, 4-9 Pending**: Require browser execution (see CLAUDE.md for procedures)

**To complete verification**: Open browser to http://localhost:3000/gm/ and follow test procedures in CLAUDE.md
