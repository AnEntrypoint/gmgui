# AgentGUI

Multi-agent GUI client for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Goose, etc.) with real-time streaming, WebSocket sync, and SQLite persistence.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # node server.js --watch

## Key Details

- Express is used only for file upload (`/api/upload/:conversationId`) and fsbrowse file browser (`/files/:conversationId`). All other routes use raw `http.createServer` with manual routing.
- Agent discovery scans PATH for known CLI binaries (claude, opencode, gemini, goose, etc.) at startup.
- Database lives at `~/.gmgui/data.db`. Tables: conversations, messages, events, sessions, stream chunks.
- WebSocket endpoint is at `BASE_URL + /sync`. Supports subscribe/unsubscribe by sessionId or conversationId, and ping.

## Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `BASE_URL` - URL prefix (default: /gm)
- `STARTUP_CWD` - Working directory passed to agents
- `HOT_RELOAD` - Set to "false" to disable watch mode

## ACP Tool Lifecycle

On startup, agentgui auto-launches bundled ACP tools (opencode, kilo) as HTTP servers:
- OpenCode: port 18100 (`opencode acp --port 18100`)
- Kilo: port 18101 (`kilo acp --port 18101`)

Managed by `lib/acp-manager.js`. Features: crash restart with exponential backoff (max 10 in 5min), health checks every 30s via `GET /provider`, clean shutdown on SIGTERM. The `acpPort` field on discovered agents is set automatically once healthy. Models are queried from the running ACP HTTP servers via their `/provider` endpoint.

## REST API

All routes are prefixed with `BASE_URL` (default `/gm`).

## Tool Update System

Tool updates are managed through a complete pipeline:

**Update Flow:**
1. Frontend (`static/js/tools-manager.js`) initiates POST to `/api/tools/{id}/update`
2. Server (`server.js` lines 1904-1961 for individual, 1973-2003 for batch) spawns bun x process
3. Tool manager (`lib/tool-manager.js` lines 400-432) executes `bun x <package>` and detects new version
4. Version is saved to database: `queries.updateToolStatus(toolId, { version, status: 'installed' })`
5. WebSocket broadcasts `tool_update_complete` with version and status data
6. Frontend updates UI and removes tool from `operationInProgress` set

**Critical Detail:** When updating tools in batch (`/api/tools/update`), the version parameter MUST be included in the database update call (line 1986 in server.js). This ensures database persistence across page reloads.

**Version Detection Sources** (`lib/tool-manager.js` lines 26-87):
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/plugins/{pluginId}/plugin.json`
- OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/agents/{pluginId}/plugin.json`
- Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/extensions/{pluginId}/plugin.json`
- Kilo: `~/.config/kilo/agents/{pluginId}/plugin.json`

**Database Schema** (`database.js` lines 168-199):
- Table: `tool_installations` (toolId, version, status, installed_at, error_message)
- Table: `tool_install_history` (action, status, error_message for audit trail)

## Tool Detection System

The system auto-detects installed AI coding tools via `bun x` package resolution:
- **OpenCode**: `opencode-ai` package (id: gm-oc)
- **Gemini CLI**: `@google/gemini-cli` package (id: gm-gc)
- **Kilo**: `@kilocode/cli` package (id: gm-kilo)
- **Claude Code**: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package (id: gm-cc)

Tool configuration in `lib/tool-manager.js` TOOLS array includes id, name, pkg, and pluginId. Each tool has a different plugin folder name than its npm package name:
- Claude Code: pkg='@anthropic-ai/claude-code', pluginId='gm' (stored at ~/.claude/plugins/gm/)
- Gemini CLI: pkg='@google/gemini-cli', pluginId='gm' (stored at ~/.gemini/extensions/gm/)
- Kilo: pkg='@kilocode/cli', pluginId='@kilocode/cli' (stored at ~/.config/kilo/agents/@kilocode/cli/)
- OpenCode: pkg='opencode-ai', pluginId='opencode-ai' (stored at ~/.config/opencode/agents/opencode-ai/)

Detection happens by spawning `bun x <package> --version` to check if tools are installed. Version detection uses pluginId to find the correct plugin.json file. Response from `/api/tools` includes: id, name, pkg, installed, status (one of: installed|needs_update|not_installed), isUpToDate, upgradeNeeded, hasUpdate. Frontend displays tools in UI and updates based on installation status.

### Tool Installation and Update UI Flow

When user clicks Install/Update button on a tool:

1. **Frontend** (`static/js/tools-manager.js`):
   - Immediately updates tool status to 'installing'/'updating' and re-renders UI
   - Sends POST request to `/api/tools/{id}/install` or `/api/tools/{id}/update`
   - Adds toolId to `operationInProgress` to prevent duplicate requests
   - Button becomes disabled showing progress indicator while install runs

2. **Backend** (`server.js` lines 1819-1851):
   - Receives POST request, updates database status to 'installing'/'updating'
   - Sends immediate response `{ success: true }`
   - Asynchronously calls `toolManager.install/update()` in background
   - Upon completion, broadcasts WebSocket event `tool_install_complete` or `tool_install_failed`

3. **Frontend WebSocket Handler** (`static/js/tools-manager.js` lines 138-151):
   - Listens for `tool_install_complete` or `tool_install_failed` events
   - Updates tool status and re-renders final state
   - Removes toolId from `operationInProgress`, enabling button again

The UI shows progress in three phases: immediate "Installing" status, progress bar animation during install, and final "Installed"/"Failed" status when complete.

## WebSocket Protocol

Endpoint: `BASE_URL + /sync`

Client sends:
- `{ type: "subscribe", sessionId }` or `{ type: "subscribe", conversationId }`
- `{ type: "unsubscribe", sessionId }`
- `{ type: "ping" }`

Server broadcasts:
- `streaming_start` - Agent execution started
- `streaming_progress` - New event/chunk from agent
- `streaming_complete` - Execution finished
- `streaming_error` - Execution failed
- `conversation_created`, `conversation_updated`, `conversation_deleted`
- `model_download_progress` - Voice model download progress
- `voice_list` - Available TTS voices

## Voice Model Download

Speech models (~470MB total) are downloaded automatically on server startup. No credentials required.

### Download Sources (fallback chain)
1. **GitHub LFS** (primary): `https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/models` - LFS-tracked ONNX files via `media.githubusercontent.com`, small files via `raw.githubusercontent.com`
2. **HuggingFace** (fallback): `onnx-community/whisper-base` for STT, `AnEntrypoint/sttttsmodels` for TTS

### Models
- **Whisper Base** (~280MB): encoder + decoder ONNX models, tokenizer, config files
- **TTS Models** (~190MB): mimi encoder/decoder, flow_lm, text_conditioner, tokenizer

### UI Behavior
- Voice tab is hidden until models are ready
- A circular progress indicator appears in the header during download
- Once models are downloaded, the Voice tab becomes visible
- Model status is broadcast via WebSocket `model_download_progress` events

### Cache Location
Models are stored at `~/.gmgui/models/` (whisper in `onnx-community/whisper-base/`, TTS in `tts/`).

## Tool Update Process Fix

### Issue
Tool update/install operations would complete successfully but the version display in the UI would not update to reflect the new version.

### Root Cause
The WebSocket broadcast event for tool update/install completion was missing the `version` field. The server was sending only the `freshStatus` object (which contains `installedVersion`), but not including the extracted `version` field from the tool-manager result.

Frontend expected: `data.data.version`
Backend was sending: only `data.data.installedVersion`

### Solution
Updated WebSocket broadcasts in `server.js`:
- Line 1883: Install endpoint now includes `version` in broadcast data
- Line 1942: Update endpoint now includes `version` in broadcast data
- Line 1987: Legacy install endpoint now saves `version` to database

The broadcasts now include both the immediately-detected `version` field and the comprehensive `freshStatus` object, ensuring the frontend has complete information to update the UI correctly.

### Testing
After update/install completes:
1. WebSocket event `tool_update_complete` or `tool_install_complete` is broadcast
2. Frontend receives complete data with `version`, `installedVersion`, `isUpToDate`, etc.
3. UI version display updates to show new version
4. Status reverts to "Installed" or "Up-to-date" accordingly

## Base64 Image Rendering in File Read Events

### Problem: Images Displaying as Raw Text

When an agent reads an image file, the streaming event may not have `type='file_read'`. It can arrive with any type (or fall through to the default case in the renderer switch). Without the `renderGeneric` fallback, the image data displays as raw base64 text instead of an `<img>` element.

### Event Structure for Image File Reads

Two nested structures are used by different agent versions. Both must be handled:

**Structure A** (nested under `source`):
```json
{
  "type": "<anything>",
  "path": "/path/to/image.png",
  "content": {
    "source": {
      "type": "base64",
      "data": "<base64-string>"
    },
    "media_type": "image/png"
  }
}
```

**Structure B** (flat inside `content`):
```json
{
  "type": "<anything>",
  "path": "/path/to/image.png",
  "content": {
    "type": "base64",
    "data": "<base64-string>"
  }
}
```

**Structure C** (content is raw base64 string, no wrapping object):
```json
{
  "type": "<anything>",
  "path": "/path/to/image.png",
  "content": "iVBORw0KGgo..."
}
```
Structure C is detected by `detectBase64Image()` which checks magic-byte prefixes (PNG: `iVBORw0KGgo`, JPEG: `/9j/4AAQ`, WebP: `UklGRi`, GIF: `R0lGODlh`).

### Two Rendering Paths in streaming-renderer.js

**Path 1 – Direct dispatch** (`renderEvent` switch statement):
- `case 'file_read'` routes directly to `renderFileRead(event)`.
- Handles all three content structures above.

**Path 2 – Generic fallback** (`renderGeneric`):
- Called for any event type not matched by the switch (the `default` case).
- First thing it does: check for `event.content?.source?.type === 'base64'` OR `event.content?.type === 'base64'` AND `event.path` present.
- If true, delegates to `renderFileRead(event)` so the image renders correctly.
- Without this fallback, any file-read event that arrives with an unrecognised type displays as raw key-value text.

### MIME Type Resolution in renderFileRead

Priority order inside `renderFileRead`:
1. `event.media_type` field (explicit)
2. Detected from magic bytes via `detectBase64Image()` → maps `jpeg` → `image/jpeg`, others → `image/<type>`
3. Falls back to `application/octet-stream` (shows broken image)

Always include `media_type` on the event when possible. If absent, magic-byte detection covers PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF automatically.

### Debugging Checklist When Images Show as Text

1. `console.log(event)` the raw event object arriving at the renderer — verify `content` structure.
2. Check `event.type` — if it is not `'file_read'`, the switch default fires `renderGeneric`.
3. Confirm `renderGeneric` has the base64 fallback guard at the top (search for `content?.source?.type === 'base64'`).
4. Confirm `renderFileRead` handles both `content.source.data` and `content.data` paths (both exist in the code).
5. Verify `event.path` is set — the fallback in `renderGeneric` requires `event.path` to delegate correctly.
6. If `media_type` is missing and content is not PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF, add it to the event or extend `detectBase64Image` signatures.

### Why Two Attempts Failed Before the Fix

- Attempt 1: Modified only `renderFileRead` but the event had an unrecognised type so the switch never reached `renderFileRead`.
- Attempt 2: Added fallback in `renderGeneric` but checked only `event.content?.source?.type === 'base64'` — missed Structure B where data sits directly on `event.content` (no `source` nesting).
- Fix: `renderGeneric` now checks both structures before falling through to generic key-value rendering.

## Tool Update Testing & Diagnostics

A comprehensive diagnostic page is available at `http://localhost:3000/gm/tool-update-test.html` (`static/tool-update-test.html`) with 7 interactive test sections:

1. **API Connection Test** - Verifies server HTTP connectivity
2. **Get Tools Status** - Lists all tools with their current status, versions, and update availability
3. **WebSocket Connection Test** - Tests real-time event streaming (ping/pong)
4. **Single Tool Update Test** - Triggers update for a specific tool and monitors completion
5. **Event Stream Monitoring** - Watches all WebSocket events in real-time
6. **Database Status** - Checks database accessibility and tool persistence
7. **System Info** - Displays environment and configuration details

### Batch Update Fix (Critical)

**Issue:** When updating all tools via `/api/tools/update` endpoint, tool versions were not persisted to the database because the `version` parameter was missing from the `updateToolStatus` call.

**Location:** `server.js` line 1986 in the batch update handler (`/api/tools/update`)

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (missing version):
queries.updateToolStatus(toolId, { status: 'installed', installed_at: Date.now() });

// AFTER (version preserved):
const version = result.version || null;
queries.updateToolStatus(toolId, { status: 'installed', version, installed_at: Date.now() });
```

**Impact:** Ensures tool versions are correctly saved after batch updates, enabling the UI to display accurate version information and update status across page reloads.

### Testing Tool Updates

**Manual Steps:**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/gm/tool-update-test.html`
2. Click "Get Tools List" and note current versions
3. Click "Start Update" for a tool (e.g., gm-cc)
4. Monitor WebSocket events - you should see `tool_update_progress` and `tool_update_complete`
5. Click "Check Status" to verify version was saved to database
6. Reload the page - versions should persist

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Individual tool update: version saved ✓
- Batch tool update: version saved for all tools ✓
- Database persists across page reload ✓
- Frontend shows "Up-to-date" or "Update available" ✓
- Tool install history records the action ✓

## ACP SDK Integration

### Current Status
- **@agentclientprotocol/sdk** (`^0.4.1`) has been added to dependencies
- The SDK is positioned as the main protocol for client-server and server-ACP tools communication

### Clear All Conversations Fix

**Issue:** After clicking "Clear All Conversations", the conversation threads would reappear in the sidebar.

**Root Cause:** The `all_conversations_deleted` broadcast event was being sent by the server (in `lib/ws-handlers-conv.js`), but:
1. The event type was not in the `BROADCAST_TYPES` set in `server.js`, so it wasn't being broadcast to all clients
2. The conversation manager (`static/js/conversations.js`) had no handler for this event type
3. Client cleanup in `handleAllConversationsDeleted` was incomplete

**Solution Applied:**
1. Added `'all_conversations_deleted'` to `BROADCAST_TYPES` set (server.js:4147)
2. Added event handler in conversation manager to clear all local state (conversations.js:573-577)
3. Enhanced client cleanup to clear all caches and state before reloading (client.js:1321-1330)

**Files Modified:**
- `server.js`: Added `all_conversations_deleted` to BROADCAST_TYPES
- `static/js/conversations.js`: Added handler for all_conversations_deleted event
- `static/js/client.js`: Enhanced handleAllConversationsDeleted with complete state cleanup

### Next Steps for Full ACP SDK Integration
The ACP SDK dependency has been added. Full integration would involve:
1. Replacing custom WebSocket protocol with ACP SDK's RPC/messaging layer
2. Updating `lib/acp-manager.js` to use ACP SDK for ACP tool communication
3. Migrating `lib/ws-protocol.js` handlers to use ACP SDK message types
4. Updating client-side WebSocket handlers to work with ACP SDK events

This refactoring is optional and can be done incrementally as needed.
